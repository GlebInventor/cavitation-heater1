This project presents a simple and practical cavitation-based water heater driven by a small internal combustion engine.
The system is designed to heat large volumes of water — for example, swimming pools, water tanks, or as an emergency heat source — using mechanical energy instead of electricity.

The principle is based on hydrodynamic cavitation: when a cavitator (rotor or disk type) spins at high speed, microscopic vapor bubbles form and collapse in the water flow. This process releases heat and partially disinfects the water.

A small 4-stroke engine (5–10 kW), such as one from a motor cultivator or mini tractor, drives both the cavitator and a water pump.
The system can operate on gasoline or be easily converted to gas fuel, which provides better economy and cleaner operation.
