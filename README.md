This project presents a simple and practical cavitation-based water heater driven by a small internal combustion engine.
The system is designed to heat large volumes of water — for example, swimming pools, water tanks, or as an emergency heat source — using mechanical energy instead of electricity.

The principle is based on hydrodynamic cavitation: when a cavitator (rotor or disk type) spins at high speed, microscopic vapor bubbles form and collapse in the water flow. This process releases heat and partially disinfects the water.

A small 4-stroke engine (5–10 kW), such as one from a motor cultivator or mini tractor, drives both the cavitator and a water pump.
The system can operate on gasoline or be easily converted to gas fuel, which provides better economy and cleaner operation.

Main Components

Small 4-stroke engine, 5–10 kW (motor tiller, generator, etc.)

Cavitator unit — rotor or disk type, mounted on the engine shaft

Water pump for circulation through the cavitation chamber

Option to use LPG (gas) as alternative fuel
Current Stage

Concept developed, basic design outlined. Next steps: testing cavitation unit performance and temperature rise in a prototype system.
